# yandex_coderun_solutions
In this repository, I collect my Python problem solutions from the Yandex CodeRun platform. Here you will find programs that I have written to perform various tasks on the platform. The code can serve as an example of using Python functions, classes, and methods, and also demonstrates my approaches to solving problems.
